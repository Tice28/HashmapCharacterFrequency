# HashmapCharacterFrequency
A project that takes a filepath and prints the frequency of each character in the file to the console using data stored in a hashmap. 

<h1>Introduction</h1>
This is just a short project focused around using the <b>Hashmap</b> data structure to log the frequency of characters pulled from a file. 
The idea for the project came from an older textbook, and I am using these projects
to get a better understanding of data structures in java. 

<h1>How to use</h1>
The easiest way to use this file is either to create your own project and import this folder as a package, or to simply hard code it into your project.
